# $\LaTeX$ CV

This is a $\LaTeX$ CV I've been polishing for some time. I wanted to put it into git since it'll allow me to keep updating it, but also because it'll allow me to share it with everyone else. I've gotten good feedback on it, and I hope that this will help you land your dream job.

For those of you who might ask if I have it in a word format, the answer is no, and I likely never will.
