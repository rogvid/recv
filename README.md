# $\LaTeX$ CV

This is a $\LaTeX$ CV I've been polishing for some time. I wanted to put it into git since it'll allow me to keep updating it, but also because it'll allow me to share it with everyone else. I don't consider myself an expert in designing CVs, but I've gotten good feedback on it, and that's why I'm sharing it.

For those of you who might ask if I have it in a word format, the answer is no, and I likely never will.

I that this will help you land your dream job.
