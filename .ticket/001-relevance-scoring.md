## Scoring Guidelines by Resource Type

### Work Experience Scoring

**Consider:**
1. **Role alignment**: How closely does the position match the target role?
2. **Skills used**: What percentage of required skills were used?
3. **Impact**: Did you deliver outcomes valued in the target role?
4. **Scale**: Did you work at the scale expected for the target role?
5. **Recency**: More recent experience is generally more relevant

**Example Scoring Process for Data Scientist role:**

```
Position: "Data Science Consultant at DFDS A/S"
- Role alignment: Perfect match (10)
- Skills: ML, Python, forecasting, optimization (10)
- Impact: Business outcomes with quantifiable results (10)
- Scale: Production systems, real business impact (9)
- Recency: 2018-2019 (recent enough) (8)
→ Overall: 10 (average heavily weighted toward role/skills)

Relevance scores:
  data-science: 10
  ml-engineering: 9 (had deployment component)
  consulting: 10 (client-facing role)
  research: 6 (applied work, not research)
  software-engineering: 7 (coding involved, not primary focus)
```

**Example for ML Engineering role:**

```
Position: "Research Assistant - Physics"
- Role alignment: Low (2)
- Skills: Python, data analysis, but no ML deployment (4)
- Impact: Academic papers, not production systems (3)
- Scale: Small research projects (3)
- Recency: Depends on dates (variable)
→ Overall: 3-4

Relevance scores:
  ml-engineering: 4 (minimal ML, no deployment)
  research: 9 (core research position)
  data-science: 5 (had data analysis)
  software-engineering: 3 (minimal coding)
```

---

### Education Scoring

**Consider:**
1. **Field relevance**: How related is the degree field?
2. **Curriculum**: What courses/skills are transferable?
3. **Level**: Does the degree level match role requirements?
4. **Thesis/Projects**: Did you do relevant research?
5. **Institution**: Prestige can add weight (slightly)

**Example Scoring:**

```
M.Sc. Physics (University of Southern Denmark)

For Data Science role:
  data-science: 9
  - Physics M.Sc. provides strong mathematical foundation
  - Likely includes statistics, programming, data analysis
  - Demonstrates quantitative reasoning
  - Not CS/Stats degree, so not perfect 10

For ML Engineering role:
  ml-engineering: 8
  - Math/physics background valuable for ML
  - Coding experience expected
  - Not CS degree with systems focus
  
For Software Engineering role:
  software-engineering: 6
  - Some programming expected
  - Strong problem-solving skills
  - Not CS degree with SWE focus
  
For Research Scientist role:
  research: 10
  - M.Sc. demonstrates research capability
  - Physics is rigorous research field
  - Academic training perfect fit
```

---

### Certificate Scoring

**Consider:**
1. **Topic alignment**: Does the certificate directly teach target role skills?
2. **Depth**: Specialization vs. intro course
3. **Provider credibility**: Recognized provider?
4. **Recency**: Is the content still current?
5. **Completion**: Certificate vs. audit

**Example Scoring:**

```
Deep Learning Specialization (deeplearning.ai, 2017)

For ML Engineering role:
  ml-engineering: 10
  - Core deep learning skills
  - Directly applicable to role
  - Recognized provider (Andrew Ng)
  - Hands-on projects

For Data Science role:
  data-science: 9
  - Deep learning is part of modern DS toolkit
  - Not core DS (statistics, etc.) but highly valued
  
For Data Analyst role:
  data-analyst: 3
  - Deep learning rarely used in DA roles
  - Too advanced/specialized for typical DA work
  
For Research role:
  ml-researcher: 7
  - Good foundation, but not research-focused
  - Online course, not academic credential
```

---

## Special Scoring Scenarios

### Multi-Disciplinary Roles

For positions requiring multiple skill sets (e.g., "Data Scientist with ML Engineering focus"), assign high scores (9-10) to experiences that demonstrate **both** skill sets.

**Example:**
```
Position: Data Scientist who deployed production ML models

Relevance:
  data-science: 10 (core role)
  ml-engineering: 10 (deployment component)
  software-engineering: 8 (production code)
```

---

### Domain Expertise Weighting

If a job posting emphasizes domain expertise (e.g., "Healthcare Data Scientist"), add +1 to +2 points for relevant domain experience.

**Example:**
```
Position: Data Scientist at Healthcare Company

Experience: "Data Science Consultant - DFDS (Transportation)"
  Without domain boost: data-science: 10
  With healthcare domain: Same, no boost (different domain)

Experience: "Data Scientist - Hospital Analytics"
  Without domain boost: data-science: 10
  With healthcare domain: data-science: 10 (already perfect)
  But prioritize this over other 10-rated experiences
```

---

### Seniority Considerations

**For Senior Roles:** Add weight to experiences showing:
- Leadership/mentorship (+1)
- Large-scale systems (+1)
- Strategic impact (+1)

**For Junior Roles:** Don't penalize less impactful experiences

---

### Recency Decay

**Optional:** Apply recency weighting:
- Last 2 years: No change
- 2-5 years ago: -0.5 points
- 5-10 years ago: -1 point
- 10+ years ago: -2 points

*(Only apply if you have sufficient recent experiences)*

---

## Scoring Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target Role Category
Choose primary category: data-science, ml-engineering, data-engineering, etc.

### Step 2: Review Core Skills
List the core skills for that role from the job type definition.

### Step 3: Score Each Experience
For each work/education/cert resource:
1. Read the description and accomplishments
2. List the skills demonstrated
3. Estimate skill overlap with target role
4. Consider scale, impact, and recency
5. Assign score using scale (1-10)

### Step 4: Score Multiple Job Types
Repeat for 4-6 common job types to enable flexible tailoring:
- Primary target role (your main career path)
- 2-3 adjacent roles (likely applications)
- 1-2 stretch roles (aspirational)

### Step 5: Validate Scores
- Do your highest-scored (9-10) items make sense for that role?
- Are low scores (1-4) truly not relevant?
- Is there good differentiation (not everything 7-8)?

---

## Common Scoring Mistakes

**❌ Everything scored 7-8**
- Too little differentiation
- Doesn't help with filtering
- Solution: Be more opinionated, use full scale

**❌ Overvaluing tangential skills**
- "This role used Python, so 10 for Software Engineering"
- Solution: Consider what % of role aligns, not just one skill

**❌ Undervaluing adjacent experience**
- "This wasn't ML, so score 2"
- Solution: Consider transferable skills and foundations

**❌ Ignoring recency**
- 10-year-old experience scored same as recent
- Solution: Apply recency decay or note in description

**❌ Not scoring enough job types**
- Only scoring 1-2 job types
- Solution: Score at least 5 common types for flexibility
